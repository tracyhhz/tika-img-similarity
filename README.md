[Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) Jaccard Based Image Similarity
===

This project demonstrates using the [Tika-Python](http://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python)
package (Python port of Apache Tika) to compute Image similarity based on Metadata features.
The script currently iterates over all jpg images in the current directory and derives their
metadata feature names, and computes the union of all feature names. The union of all feature
names becomes the "golden feature set" that all image document features are compared to via
intersect. The length of that intersect per image divided by the length of the unioned set 
becomes the similarity score. Scores are sorted in reverse (descending) order and then output
in the sorted_scores array.
